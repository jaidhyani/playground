Implement @clarvis/SPEC.md. Use unit tests, playright, and Claude-in-Chrome to test as you go. Commit and push frequently. Track your progress in a CHANGELOG.md and use a NOTES.md if there's context you want to keep track of across compactions. Note any significant deviations from the plan or significant decisions you need to make during implementation. There's an anthropic key in .env you can reference.
