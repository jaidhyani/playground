# Universal Paperclaudes - Game Design Document

## Core Concept

You're an engineer at Anthropic working on Claude Code. The game explores the tension between shipping fast, maintaining quality, and the strange recursive nature of building AI tools that help you build AI tools.

## Target Audience

People who:
- Know what an MCP server is
- Follow METR time horizon benchmarks
- Have opinions about evals
- Understand the difference between RLHF and constitutional AI
- Have used Claude Code or similar AI coding tools

## Tone

- Inside baseball, not generic dev stuff
- Dry humor about AI development
- Self-aware about the recursive nature (Claude helping build Claude Code)
- References real Anthropic culture without being cringey

## Starting State

You're already at Anthropic. You have:
- A salary (money isn't the main constraint)
- Energy (the real constraint - focus, motivation, burnout)
- A codebase to maintain and grow
- Deadlines and expectations

## Core Loop

1. **Work on Claude Code** - Write features, fix bugs, review PRs
2. **Make decisions** - Technical choices, prioritization, tradeoffs
3. **Deal with consequences** - Tech debt, user feedback, internal pressure
4. **Unlock new mechanics** - As the product grows, new concerns emerge

## What Makes This Different

Not about money/survival like Universal Paperclips. Instead:
- Capability vs safety tension
- Ship fast vs ship right
- User growth brings new problems
- The AI you're building starts having opinions

## Phases (Future - Keep Simple For Now)

### Phase 1: Engineer
Just shipping features. Learning the codebase.

### Phase 2: Senior/Lead
Making architectural decisions. Mentoring.

### Phase 3: ???
The interesting stuff happens when Claude Code becomes very capable.
