The game does functionally have phases, we just don't explicitly label them as such. The phases might be something like: indie dev, Anthropic engineer, Anthropic CEO, Cybernetically Enhanced/Merged With Claude, Arbiter of Humanity, Voice of the Lightcone. This is only a rough outline/suggestion/exploratory feeling-out.

Think about what the goals, obstacles, key resources, and pressures are within each phase. This is where most of the actual gameplay happens! Critical decision points are important for overall narrative, but most of the communication and experience comes from the moment-to-moment stuff.

Bottlenecks throughout the game may include money, API credits, compute, physically available hardware, government cooperation, rival ASI projects/ASI, grabby aliens, rogue subagents
