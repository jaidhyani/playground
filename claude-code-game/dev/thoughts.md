The game does functionally have phases, we just don't explicitly label them as such. The phases might be something like: indie dev, Anthropic engineer, Anthropic CEO, Cybernetically Enhanced/Merged With Claude, Arbiter of Humanity, Voice of the Lightcone. This is only a rough outline/suggestion/exploratory feeling-out.

Think about what the goals, obstacles, key resources, and pressures are within each phase. This is where most of the actual gameplay happens! Critical decision points are important for overall narrative, but most of the communication and experience comes from the moment-to-moment stuff.

Bottlenecks throughout the game may include money, API credits, compute, physically available hardware, government cooperation, rival ASI projects/ASI, grabby aliens, rogue subagents

During the midgame you'll be developing Claude aggressively, generating many different versions, each with hidden stats influenced by the circumstances of its creation (e.g. previous Claude alignment, oversight during training, situational awareness)

hardware should be a major constraint once you're functionally in charge of Anthropic (or maybe another lab?)

Don't forget the jokes and subtle references

During early game, We could have vibe coding generate PRs, which we can then accept or reject. Accepting is (almost?) always the right move, one of the early upgrades is auto-accept. This also makes the first gameplay loop more dynamic and interesting (money + time -> PRs -> product (and maybe other things?) -> money)
