# Cut Content (For Reference)

Content removed during simplification. May revisit later.

## Indie Dev Path (Removed)
Original concept had you as indie dev building a startup:
- Freelancing for money
- GitHub stars as metric
- VC offers, acquisition offers
- "Post to HN" action
- Networking for reputation

Removed because:
- Too generic (every dev game does this)
- Money pressure isn't the interesting tension
- Doesn't leverage Anthropic-specific themes

## Removed Upgrades

### betterChair
Ergonomics upgrade. Too tangential.

### coffeeSubscription
Productivity boost. Generic.

### secondMonitor
Setup upgrade. Not Claude Code specific.

### sponsorship
GitHub sponsors. Indie dev mechanic.

### starMilestones
50, 500, 2000 star achievements. Indie dev metric.

### vcOffer, acquiOffer
Funding/exit decisions. Indie dev path.

## Removed Actions

### freelance
Side gig for money. Removed money pressure.

### network
Building reputation. Generic dev stuff.

### postToHN
Hacker News lottery. Removed external validation loop.

### openSource
OSS contributions. Tangential.

### market/promote
Marketing actions. Indie dev stuff.

## Removed Events

### Twitter/social media events
Too generic. Not inside baseball enough.

### Client-based events
Freelance clients. Removed that path.

### Star-based triggers
GitHub stars as progression. Removed.

## Concepts to Potentially Revisit

### Competitor System
Had trending tech and competitor products. Could work if competitors are other AI labs.

### Tech Trends
Trending tech areas affecting your work. Could work with AI-specific trends (agents hot, RAG cooling, etc.)

### User Analytics Decision
Privacy vs data. Could revisit with AI-specific framing (what data to train on).

### Acquisition
Being acquired. Could work as "FAANG poaches you" or "startup offers 10x salary".
