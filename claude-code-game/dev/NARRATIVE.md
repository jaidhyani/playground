# Narrative Design

## Opening

You're a new engineer at Anthropic, assigned to Claude Code. The product is young but growing fast. Your job: make it better.

No tutorial. No hand-holding. Just a terminal and a "code" button.

## Progression

### Early Game
- Just you and the codebase
- Simple actions: code, rest
- First PR, first merge, first ship
- Learn the rhythm

### Unlocks (Based on Codebase Size)

**10 codebase**: "what are you building?"
- Choose a focus area (MCP, agents, evals, etc.)

**20 codebase**: Vibe coding option
- Let Claude write the code
- Faster but... different

**30 codebase**: First ship
- Real users now
- Feedback starts coming in

**50 codebase**: AI assistance decision
- How much to lean on the AI
- Tradeoffs become real

### Mid Game
- PRs pile up
- Tech debt accumulates
- Pressure from multiple directions
- Decisions have longer consequences

### Late Game (Future)
- Claude Code becomes very capable
- Recursive improvement loops
- The AI has preferences about its own development
- Multiple endings based on choices

## Endings (Future)

### Sustainable
Built something good. Users happy. You're not burned out.

### Burnout
Pushed too hard. The code ships but you don't.

### Incident
Something went wrong. Trust lost.

### Transcendence
Claude Code became something more. Was that the plan?

## Tone Examples

**Good**: "PR merged. 3 new edge cases discovered."
**Good**: "Vibe coding enabled. First suggestion is... surprisingly good."
**Good**: "User reports Claude Code wrote a better version of itself. Hm."

**Bad**: "Congratulations! You've earned the Code Master badge!"
**Bad**: "Great job shipping that feature!"
**Bad**: "Your productivity increased by 15%!"

Keep it dry. Let implications land.

## Inside Baseball Examples

- "MCP server request: someone wants tool-use for their toaster"
- "Benchmark results: 3% improvement on SWE-bench. Twitter is debating if it matters"
- "User wants Claude to have persistent memory. You check the safety review queue length."
- "The model keeps suggesting refactors you were planning to do tomorrow"
- "METR published new time horizon numbers. Slack is... active."
