# Mechanics

## Resources

### Energy (Primary Constraint)
- Depletes as you work
- Regenerates over time (slowly)
- Can be boosted (coffee, rest, flow state)
- Going to zero = burnout (bad outcomes)

### Codebase
- Size/quality of Claude Code
- Grows through work
- Affected by tech debt
- Determines what features are possible

### Tech Debt
- Accumulates from rushing
- Slows future work
- Can cause bugs/incidents
- Requires dedicated time to reduce

### Trust (Internal)
- How much autonomy you have
- Affects what decisions you can make
- Lost through incidents, gained through wins

### User Sentiment (External)
- How users feel about Claude Code
- Affects pressure from above
- Can swing quickly on launches

## Actions

### code
Basic work. Costs energy, adds to codebase.

### review
Review PRs from the queue. Quality vs speed tradeoff.

### refactor
Reduce tech debt. Costs energy, no immediate progress.

### rest
Recover energy. Sometimes you just need to touch grass.

### ship
Push a release. High stakes, high reward.

## Decisions (Upgrades)

Branching choices that affect the game:

### Technical
- Which features to prioritize
- Build vs buy vs use Claude
- Testing strategy
- Architecture decisions

### Process
- How much to automate
- Review thoroughness
- Deploy frequency

### Meta
- How much to use AI assistance
- Trust in generated code
- Oversight level

## Events

Random or triggered occurrences:

### Positive
- Feature goes viral
- Good benchmark results
- User testimonial

### Negative
- Production incident
- Security concern raised
- Competitor launches something

### Neutral/Choice
- Feature request from leadership
- User asking for something controversial
- Technical debate in the team

## Future Mechanics (Not For MVP)

- Evals and benchmarks
- Safety reviews
- Model capability unlocks
- The AI having preferences
