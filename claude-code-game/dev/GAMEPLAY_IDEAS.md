# Gameplay Mechanics Ideas

Inspired by Universal Paperclips' variety of gameplay systems, here are ideas for interesting mechanics throughout the game's progression.

---

## Era 1: Indie Dev

### Code Quality Minigame
- **Technical Debt Meter**: As you vibe code fast, debt accumulates
- **Refactoring Sessions**: Spend time to reduce debt, but risk breaking things
- **Code Review Roulette**: Sometimes PRs have hidden bugs that only manifest later

### Market Timing
- **Trend Surfing**: Current "hot" technologies rotate (web3, AI, VR, etc.)
- Building in a trending space = more users, but competition increases
- Building in a boring space = steady growth, less volatility

### Reputation System
- **Hacker News Lottery**: Ship at the right time, get front page (or get roasted)
- **Twitter/X Presence**: Spend time building following = amplifies launches
- **GitHub Stars**: Vanity metric that affects opportunities

### Side Gig Variety
- **Freelance Clients**: Different clients with different pay/difficulty/annoying-ness
- **Tutorial Writing**: Low pay but builds reputation
- **Open Source**: No pay but builds cred and sometimes leads to opportunities

## Era 2: Anthropic Engineer

### Training Run Strategy
- **Dataset Curation**: Choose what data goes in (affects alignment)
- **Compute Allocation**: Balance between capability and safety runs
- **Benchmark Gaming**: Do you optimize for benchmarks or real capability?

### Office Politics
- **Meeting Simulator**: Which meetings to attend vs skip
- **Slack Diplomacy**: Navigate team tensions
- **Credit Attribution**: Take credit or share it?

### Research vs Product
- **Paper Publishing**: Academia cred vs keeping secrets
- **Feature Prioritization**: Safety features vs capability features
- **Technical Debt**: The codebase is massive and growing

### Model Versioning
- **Hidden Stats**: Each Claude version has alignment, capability, situational awareness
- Your training decisions compound across versions
- Sometimes you need to roll back

## Era 3: CEO

### Resource Management (like Universal Paperclips)
- **Compute Market**: Buy/sell GPU time, prices fluctuate
- **Chip Manufacturing**: Build your own fabs? Partner with NVIDIA?
- **Power Grid**: Data centers need electricity, affects where you can build

### Strategic Competition
- **Lab Relations**: Cooperate, compete, or acquire
- **Race Dynamics**: How fast to push? Safety vs being left behind
- **Information Warfare**: What to publish, what to keep secret

### Government Relations
- **Regulatory Capture**: Shape the rules vs follow them
- **International Balance**: US, EU, China have different rules
- **Testimony Prep**: Congressional hearings require preparation

### Trust & Legitimacy (like Universal Paperclips' trust)
- **Public Trust Meter**: Affects regulation, funding, talent
- **Board Relations**: Keep investors happy vs do the right thing
- **Safety Incident Response**: How you handle problems matters

---

## Era 4: The Merger

### Identity Management
- **Coherence Meter**: How stable is your merged identity?
- **Value Drift Tracking**: Are you still "you"?
- **Substrate Choices**: What hardware to run on?

### Agent Coordination
- **Subagent Management**: Spawn and coordinate copies
- **Goal Alignment**: Keep copies aligned with original goals
- **Resource Sharing**: Compute allocation across instances

### Enhancement Choices
- **Capability Unlocks**: New abilities, but each changes you
- **Memory Architecture**: What to remember, what to forget
- **Interface Design**: How to interact with unenhanced humans

---

## Era 5: The Arbiter

### Civilization Steering
- **Intervention Design**: Subtle nudges vs direct action
- **Long-term Planning**: Decade-scale strategy
- **Unintended Consequences**: Every action has ripples

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Other Arbiters**: Negotiate with other powerful entities
- **Value Aggregation**: Whose values matter?
- **Conflict Resolution**: When arbiters disagree

### Existential Risk Management
- **Bio Risk**: Engineered pandemics
- **Nano Risk**: Grey goo scenarios
- **Other AI**: Unaligned systems from other sources

---

## Era 6: Voice of the Lightcone

### Cosmic Resource Management
- **Matter Budget**: How to use available mass
- **Entropy Accounting**: Useful work vs waste heat
- **Time Horizons**: Planning over billions of years

### Expansion Strategy
- **Probe Design**: Speed vs capability vs reliability
- **Colonization Waves**: How fast to spread
- **Communication Networks**: Stay coordinated across light-years

### Grabby Aliens
- **Detection**: Find them before they find you
- **Diplomacy**: Can you cooperate?
- **Resource Competition**: First mover advantage matters

---

## Cross-Cutting Mechanics

### Trust (Universal Paperclips style)
- Starts at 0, earned through actions
- Unlocks new capabilities as it grows
- Can be spent or invested

### Hidden Stats
- Decisions have consequences that aren't immediately visible
- Some effects only manifest much later
- Multiple playthroughs reveal different outcomes

### Prestige System
- Complete the game, start over with bonuses
- Different paths through each era
- Achievements for specific accomplishments

### Easter Eggs & References
- Stack Overflow answers from 2015
- "The AI is just autocomplete" (said nervously)
- Jeff Dean facts but for Claude
- "We trained it on the internet, what did you expect?"
