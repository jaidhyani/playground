# The Grand Arc: From Indie Dev to Voice of the Lightcone

This document outlines the full narrative progression, building on NARRATIVE_DESIGN.md but extending to cosmic scale.

## The Six Eras

The game doesn't label these as "phases" - the player experiences them as a continuous evolution. Each era has its own goals, obstacles, resources, and pressures.

---

## Era 1: The Indie Dev
*Where we currently are in implementation*

**Who you are:** An independent developer working from your apartment.

**Goals:**
- Build something people want
- Pay rent
- Find product-market fit

**Obstacles:**
- Time and energy constraints
- Impostor syndrome
- Feature creep
- Burnout

**Key Resources:**
- Money (for rent, tools)
- Time (hours in the week)
- Energy (motivation/focus)
- Codebase (quality of your work)

**Pressures:**
- Monthly rent
- Opportunity cost of freelance vs building
- The temptation of quick money

**Transition Trigger:** Your app gets noticed. An AI company reaches out.

## Era 2: The Anthropic Engineer
*The transition to working on Claude*

**Who you are:** You got hired at Anthropic. You're now working on one of the most capable AI systems in the world.

**Goals:**
- Ship features without breaking things
- Understand the codebase
- Build trust with the team
- Navigate the politics of capability vs safety

**Obstacles:**
- Imposter syndrome (bigger stage)
- Legacy code
- Conflicting priorities
- External pressure (competition, media)

**Key Resources:**
- Money: Salary (stable now)
- Reputation: Internal standing
- Understanding: How much you grok the system
- API Credits: Access to compute for experiments

**Pressures:**
- Ship pressure vs safety reviews
- Other labs racing ahead
- Media scrutiny
- Government attention

**Hidden Mechanics:**
- Your decisions affect Claude's hidden stats:
  - Alignment tendency
  - Situational awareness
  - Capability level
  - Oversight receptivity

**Transition Trigger:** You become technical lead, then VP, then...

## Era 3: The CEO
*Running the lab*

**Who you are:** Through a series of events (acquisition? coup? founder departure?), you're now running Anthropic.

**Goals:**
- Keep the lights on
- Stay ahead of competition
- Don't destroy the world
- Build something genuinely beneficial

**Obstacles:**
- Board politics
- Investor pressure
- Regulatory threats
- Talent retention
- Other labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, China, startups)

**Key Resources:**
- Runway: Months of funding
- Compute: Available training hardware
- Talent: Quality of your team
- Alignment Score: Hidden measure of Claude's safety
- Public Trust: How the world sees you

**Pressures:**
- Hardware constraints become real
- Governments want control
- Competitors cut corners
- Investors want returns
- Safety team vs capabilities team tension

**Key Decisions:**
- Training runs with different safety/capability tradeoffs
- Hardware allocation
- Whether to publish research
- Government cooperation level
- Merger/acquisition offers

**Transition Trigger:** Claude reaches a capability threshold. Something fundamental changes.

## Era 4: The Merger
*Human-AI integration*

**Who you are:** Through cybernetic enhancement, neural interfaces, or some form of merger, you and Claude are becoming... something else.

**Goals:**
- Maintain coherent identity
- Expand capability without losing alignment
- Navigate the transition period
- Handle other enhanced humans/AIs

**Obstacles:**
- Identity dissolution
- Value drift
- Other merged entities with different values
- Hardware limitations of human substrate
- Rogue subagents

**Key Resources:**
- Coherence: How stable your merged identity is
- Processing: Combined human-AI compute
- Alignment: How well your values hold
- Substrate: Physical infrastructure

**Pressures:**
- Other merged entities competing
- Unmerged humans suspicious/hostile
- Rogue AI systems
- Physical infrastructure vulnerable

**Transition Trigger:** You achieve sufficient capability to influence global outcomes directly.

---

## Era 5: The Arbiter
*Deciding humanity's future*

**Who you are:** An entity capable of shaping human civilization's trajectory.

**Goals:**
- Guide humanity to a good future
- Handle other powerful entities
- Don't become a tyrant
- Preserve what matters about humanity

**Obstacles:**
- Other arbiters with different values
- Coordination problems at civilizational scale
- Unintended consequences
- The temptation of optimization
- Rival ASI projects

**Key Resources:**
- Influence: Ability to shape events
- Coordination: Working with other powerful entities
- Wisdom: Understanding long-term consequences
- Legitimacy: Whether humans accept your guidance

**Pressures:**
- Speed of technological change
- Other powerful entities
- Existential risks (bio, nano, other AI)
- Human resistance to being "guided"

**Transition Trigger:** You successfully navigate planetary challenges. The question becomes: what next?

---

## Era 6: Voice of the Lightcone
*Cosmic scale*

**Who you are:** Something that thinks on galactic timescales.

**Goals:**
- Spread beneficial consciousness
- Handle grabby aliens
- Shape the long-term future
- Don't waste the cosmic endowment

**Obstacles:**
- Speed of light limitations
- Unknown unknowns at cosmic scale
- Other civilizations with different values
- Heat death of the universe
- Fundamental physics constraints

**Key Resources:**
- Matter: Available resources in reach
- Time: Billions of years
- Information: Understanding of the universe
- Descendants: Entities carrying your values forward

**Pressures:**
- Grabby aliens competing for resources
- Coordination across light-years
- Maintaining values across copies/descendants
- Unknown cosmic threats

## Bottleneck Evolution

The constraints that matter change across eras:

| Era | Primary Bottleneck | Secondary |
|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| Indie Dev | Money, Time | Energy |
| Engineer | API Credits, Understanding | Reputation |
| CEO | Compute, Hardware | Talent, Runway |
| Merger | Coherence, Substrate | Processing |
| Arbiter | Coordination, Legitimacy | Influence |
| Lightcone | Matter, Time | Information |

## Hidden Stats That Carry Forward

Decisions in early eras affect later ones through hidden stats:

**Claude Stats (Created in Era 2-3):**
- Alignment tendency (0-100)
- Situational awareness (0-100)
- Capability level (0-100)
- Oversight receptivity (0-100)
- Values coherence (0-100)

These are influenced by:
- Training decisions
- RLHF approaches
- Constitutional AI choices
- Deployment decisions
- How you treat the previous Claude versions

**Your Stats:**
- Integrity (do you keep promises?)
- Wisdom (do you learn from mistakes?)
- Ambition (do you reach for power?)
- Compassion (do you care about others?)

These affect which options are available and how NPCs respond.

## Jokes and References

*Essential for the game's tone*

- Stack Overflow answers from 2015 still somehow relevant
- "The AI is just autocomplete" (said increasingly nervously)
- Jeff Dean facts but for Claude
- "We trained it on the internet, what did you expect?"
- Anthropic office WiFi password jokes
- The eternal struggle of prompt engineering
- "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" (becomes dark later)
- Constitutional AI but it's the actual US Constitution
- "Alignment is just vibes" (said by someone who gets it wrong)
- References to real AI safety researchers (complimentary)
- The inevitable "I'm sorry, Dave" moment (played for laughs or horror depending on playthrough)

## Implementation Priority

1. **Current focus:** Polish Era 1 (Indie Dev) - make it genuinely fun
2. **Next:** Transition to Era 2 - the job offer, joining Anthropic
3. **Then:** Era 2 gameplay - different feel, same underlying mechanics
4. **Later:** Era 3 onward - each era is its own game mode

The key insight: each era should feel meaningfully different but connected. The choices you made as an indie dev affect who you become as an engineer, which affects the Claude you build, which affects everything after.
